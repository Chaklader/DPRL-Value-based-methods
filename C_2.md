# C-2: Classical RL Methods

1. Dynamic Programming Approaches

   - Policy Evaluation and Improvement
   - Value Iteration
   - Limitations of Model-Based Methods

2. Monte Carlo Methods

   - Exploring Policy Space
   - First-Visit and Every-Visit MC
   - MC Prediction and Control
   - Exploration vs Exploitation

3. Temporal Difference Learning
   - TD(0) and Bootstrapping
   - SARSA: On-Policy TD Control
   - Q-Learning: Off-Policy TD Control
   - Expected SARSA
